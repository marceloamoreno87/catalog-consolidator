# Catalog Consolidation

A traditional e-commerce company will start operating as a marketplace (a store that sells products from other stores). Marketplaces frequently receive product catalogs from multiple sellers (stores that sell their products on the marketplace).

Currently, this company has a product catalog that contains all the items it sells. The store must be capable of receiving products from different sellers and adding them to its catalog. It is important to note that it is common for a product to be sold by several stores. Each seller registers their own products, so there may be slight variations in the information for the same item across different stores. Duplicating items is undesirable. However, it is crucial to record which sellers offer each product.

You will receive a SQLite database populated with products. This database has only 2 tables: a product table and a table to link products to sellers.

Implement a catalog consolidation system that receives a file containing products from different sellers and saves them to the catalog database. In the case of a duplicate product, the system should not insert the item into the product table but should link the existing item to the seller in the appropriate table.

Demonstrating mastery of the problem and understanding of the solution is more important than presenting a scalable, production-ready implementation.

This challenge contains some intentional ambiguities. They are part of the assessment.

You may make changes to the database if you deem them necessary.

The use of AI agents in the solution's implementation is permitted and encouraged.
